# picture-dl
Command-line program to download pictures from instagram and other picture sites

#Dependency (for the moment) :
os, re, urllib2, ast

picture-dl is only at the very beginning of development.
The goal is to do the equivalent of youtube-dl but for the images.
I tried to leave the source code as simple as possible, but it's been a while since I've made any progress.
There is still a lot of work to do, so if you want to contribute you are welcome ;)

I started python 1 or 2 years ago, and this is my first (serious) program. So don't hesitate to make corrections/modifications too!

It's also the first time I've used github.... So if you have any advice, I'll take it!
